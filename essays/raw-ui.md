## What is a Front-End Developer?
To consider yourself to be a front-end developer, you have to understand CSS. This is because CSS is a core part of every website along with HTML and Javascript. However, that doesn't mean raw CSS and HTML doesn't come with its problems. Raw CSS and HTML have issues of being border-line outdated in terms of user easibility, but provides maximum user flexibility.
So which is it, do I learn raw CSS/HTML or stick with UI Frameworks?

## The Opinion
Raw CSS/HTML is hard to learn and hard to master, whilst UI Frameworks are easier to learn and easier to master. Raw CSS/HTML needs to be hard-coded in order for you to present a managable website. And because of this, sometimes you're guessing margins in order to establish a text or an image. Users who are gifted in coding to the point where they can pull (x,y) coordinates just by THOUGHT alone may not find this as an issue but as an individual who uses a calculator to check if, 7 + 3 equals 10 during an exam, I find coordinate guessing to be troublesome. On the other hand, UI Frameworks provide easier access to website design. Instead of attempting to guess whether a text or an image belongs at a certain coordinate, if you were using Semantic UI, you could just call, ```<div class="ui left item/image> ``` to move its position. Not only does Semantic UI provide easier access in website design, but also easier implentation in new formats. What if you needed to create a list or apply a spreadsheet to a website to display data? Semantic UI is just one or two keywords off in creating that feature for your website.

## It's Big Brain Time
Let's be honest. Nobody wants to learn raw HTML/CSS. Raw CSS/HTML is terrible to look at in terms of code cleaniness and readability. However, you still have to learn it. As stated before, if you want to be a front-end developer, you need to learn native CSS and HTML. That doesn't mean you can't use UI Frameworks for your website. The trend for website design has changed from a homepage cluttered with useless information, into simple and clean designs. Usually consisting of big pictures that take up the entire screen. If the simple framework of, 'topmenu > middle picture > foote' works, might as well just use a UI Framework such as Semantic UI that accomplishes the design in under 20 minutes.

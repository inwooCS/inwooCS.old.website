## Overview 
The Problem:
Students purchase books, calculators, unused folders, and any school related items for classes, once you finish the semester and pass the class, you are left with the items purchased, and no concrete way of getting your money back, other than selling over some third party application, or selling it back to the bookstore for 50%+ less than you paid for it.

The Solution:
UH Manoa Marketplace is a online hub to look for, purchase, or sell books, pencils, and anything school related by posting pictures of the merchandise, with a  price tag, and users who are interested can contact the seller via email or within the app, and can meet up if an agreement is settled upon

## Approach 
Once a profile is created, users can browse through other sellers postings or post their own items for sale.
Users can set up categories to search for, such as books, technology, or other items that may be of interest
Admins may log in to check postings, See a full lay out of most recent postings and make sure all are appropriate, if it is not, it can be removed and a warning will be issued to the seller

Mock up pages:
Landing page ( Show a wide variety of recent postings, ability to search for a certain product by name )
User home page ( this will show all of your postings of what you are trying to sell )
Other users  home page ( show all items currently being sold by a user )

## Case Ideas
New users goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, sets up profile and start their listing.
Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page. 
User goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page. Home page shows other listings, profile page shows who's interested. 

## Beyond the basics 
Provide a map of campus with the most crowded locations for safety. The map may also show current locations of emergency phone booths placed around campus. Both parties can agree where to meet up through the map and a log will be recorded. 
Support reviews where sellers and buyers can rate each other in terms of how well the trade went, and honesty/shady-ness

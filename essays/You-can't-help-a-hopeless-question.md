## Talking In Circles 
It is important to understand that asking a question is a skill that needs to be learned. In a professional work environment, you will encounter a situation where you will not know how to solve a particular problem. If you were to ask a general question, you will in turn receive a general response. This is why asking smart questions is important. Asking smart questions remove room for error, redundancy, and provides an efficient exchange in information. Talking in circles will lead to no where, and asking redundant questions that already have been answered on the internet is a waste of time. To maximize efficiency, stop asking dumb questions, and ask smarter questions.

## Role Models 

[Prime Example 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/762011/whats-the-difference-between-using-let-and-var).
In this first example, the developer asks, "What is the difference between using let and var?" This is a good example of a smart question because not only does he provide a clear central question, but also relevant context. He provides a link to the ECMAScript 6 informational page that provides their official definition of the "let" statement, which shows he has tried answering the question by himself first, but still needs guidance. He states, "I've heard that it is described as a local variable, but I'm still not quite sure how it behaves differently than the var keyword." Which helps stackoverflow provide more information on the question than just a repeat of the official definition provided by ES6. You can also infer that the question asked, although simple, is a smart question by the answers given by stackoverflow. 

[Prime Example 2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7520432/what-is-the-difference-between-and-equals-in-java).
This is another example of a smart question. The developer asks, "what is the difference between == and .equals()?" They mention further that they understand that == is a reference comparison and .equals() evaluates to the comparison values in the objects, but they are still confused on the concept. This is another example of a smart question because not only is the question simple and concise, but also provides context to the question and provides insight that they somewhat answered the question, but would like further explanation. You can also infer that the question was a smart one due to the answers in the thread. They all discuss the relevant differences between the two and even provide examples (code) to explain the concept further.

## Redundancies
[Prime Example 3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1643067/whats-the-difference-between-equals-and).
This is not a smart question. Similarly to, 'Prime Example 2' the user asks, "What's the difference between .equals and ==?" However, they did not follow a particular step when asking a smart question. Checking if the question was already answered. The first thing you see when you click on this question on stackoverflow is a blatantly blue, tagged message that says, "This question already has been answered here." linking to the same exact question. Asking the same question when it has already been answered is just redundant and a waste of time to both the developer, and those who are trying to help others understand concepts. 

[Prime Example 4](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11644858/bubblesort-implementation).
Lastly, this is another example of not a smart question. Firstly, the developer does not even ask a question. The title just states, "bubblesort implementation." The only context the developer provides is, "I tried to make an implementation of bubble sort, but I am not sure whether it is correct or not. If you can give it a look and if it is a bubble sort and can be done in better way please don't be shy. Here is the code." To begin with, this developer is obviously lazy. They want somebody to look at their code and quickly provide them a solution to their problem. But at first glance, there is no problem, because there is no question. The developer isn't asking for guidance, but the answer to the problem. This does not benefit the developer in the long run because they will not understand the concept if they just look at the solution. This also will not benefit future lurkers of stackoverflow because without key words presented in a question format, they will not be able to find this thread. Overall, this thread is a mess. At least the comments were nice enough to provide a working bubble sort which you can literally copy and paste from the GeeksforGeeks website.  

## Insight
The insights I gained as a result of searching for dumb and smart questions is phenomenal. I learned that it is easier to find smart questions because smart questions will have proper grammar, simple but effective key words, and some form of context to show how they attempted to solve a problem. We as software engineers can all learn a thing or to about asking smart questions. Maybe one day we can obtain enough knowledge to help other developers answer smart questions of their own.

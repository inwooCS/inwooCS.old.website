##Skip Talking In Circles 
It is important to understand that asking a question is a skill that needs to be learned. In a professional work environment, you will encounter a situation where you do not know how to solve a particular problem. If you were to ask a general question, you will in turn receieve a general response. This is why asking smart questions is important. Asking smart questions remove room for error, redundancy, and provides an efficient exchange in information. The only way for a software engineer to learn the best, they must ask the mentors before them smart questions. 

##Role Models 
In this first example, the developer asks, "What is the difference between using let and var?" This is a good example of a smart question because not only does he provide a clear central question, but also relevant context. He provides a link to the ECMAScript 6 informational page that provides their official definition of the "let" statement, which shows he has tried answering the question by himself first, but still needs guidance. He states, "I've heard that it is described as a local variable, but I'm still not quite sure how it behaves differently than the var keyword." Which helps stackoverflow provide more information on the question than just a repeat of the official definition provided by ES6. You can also infer that the question asked, although simple, is a smart question by the answers given by stackoverflow.

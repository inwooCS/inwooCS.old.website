## Prologue  
Before disaster struck the United States, I spent everyday doing, "nothing". Like clock-work, I followed the same routine for weeks; wake up, school, dinner, work, ICSpace, home. You could argue I wasn't really doing, "nothing" because I spent every hour of the day for a task I had to complete, but I disagree. The time I spent was for nothing because those tasks were not the things I wanted to do. I wanted to explore the world. I wanted to enjoy the company of friends. I wanted to prepare myself for the future. Unfortunately, those goals will have to stay on hold until the pandemic blows over. 

## What changed? 

The obvious change is my daily routine. Now that quarantine started, I am not able to go outside unless I'm shopping for groceries  because my role in society is not, "essential." I've been waking up late because all classes went virtual so it is very easy to fake attendance. I've been spending more time sitting down on my computer due to the lack of commuting to school and work. All in all, my daily routine is very unhealty and I am considering purchasing a desk where you have to stand in order to help my deteriorating health. 

## The Truth 
What additional family, community, or work obligations you are taking on?
My parents own two businesses that are in the brink of bankruptcy due to the lack of clients and customers. You don't know how much we needed the $10k bailout from the federal government that was issued a few days ago or the unemployment insurance that extended its poliy to include my parents situation. 2020 has been very unfortunate but ## it is what it is. 

## Responsbility 
Due to the (now) heavily enforced quarantine, I had to take on more responsibility. I am a mere computer science college student with little-to-no real life experience and street knowledge. However, I do know about computers. The first, "suggested" quarantine happened before spring break. As a responsible religious institution, we took the quarantine warning very seriously and prepared to switch to online ASAP. The timing couldn't have been more perfect as spring break provided an entire week to troubleshoot Zoom and Youtube Live. My church even promoted my role to Broadcast (lmao). By the end of the week, I set up Youtube Live through OBS, saved the church some money by finding hand-me-down webcams and mics, and provided easy access to Zoom for the senior citizens that go to our church.

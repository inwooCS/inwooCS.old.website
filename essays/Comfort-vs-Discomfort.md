## The Threshold
There is an arbitrary line between comfort and discomfort. People naturally take the path of least resistance because it is the comforting choice. However, you can't grow as an individual if you don't take risks that remove you from your comfort zone. Why bother learning something new when what you know is enough? The simple answer is, what you know isn't enough. Our brains constantly desire more knowledge and information even when our habits bottleneck our ability to learn. If you want to develop as a person, you need to start moving towards that line. And for me, that line was taking a class on software engineering.

## First Impressions
I was tasked in completing 100+ coding assignments which I would equvilate to a crash course version of learning Javascript's and ES6's syntax and lexicon. After two hours of zoning out the world, I was relieved that it wasn't as painful as I thought. Ironically, I would describe Javascript as a comfort language. The first coding language I learned was Java and I had noticed that the syntax Javascript uses is fairly similar. Of course this assessment is subject to change as I learn more about Javascript and how it is used in software engineering, but I stand by my first impression.

## Expectations
Looking through the modules, I expect several things from the class and myself. I expect the class to provide me with an abundance of knowledge on software engineering and especially the ability to proficiently airticulate Javascript. What I expect from myself is to take what the class has provided me, become comfortable with it, and move onto the next discomforting thing.

## Food For Thought

The greatest thing about computer science is the ability to learn something new every day. Unlike most professions, computer science evolves by the minute. Whenever you decide to write a program to solve a problem in the world, you help contribute to this very same idea. I wish to do the same. Software engineering provides me with the tools necessary to make the world a better place.

## The Why
Although my major is computer science with a focus in cyber security, I am interested in learning software engineering. Software engineering teaches you important skills that you will need in the future. These skills are, but not limited to: Object-oriented design, software testing/debugging, problem solving, and teamwork. There is a common notion that coders will spend more time debugging a software than writing actual code. The more time spent debugging means less time spent developing my code. I do not wish to be that type of coder.

## Life Lesson
Obviously, in order to have the knowledge capable of writing software, I will heavily depend on talent and practice. Unfortunately, I am not a child prodigy. On several occasions, I would need to spend more time reading and re-reading the same line of code in order to understand what it is doing. And I believe that's fine. That is the beauty of learning how to code. It doesn't matter if you don't understand the code now or tomorrow, if you are willing to put the time and effort in understanding the content, you will eventually understand. Out of all the skills I wish to develop from software engineering, I wish to develop the skill to understand even when it seems impossible.

There is no right way to learn. Humans are naturally gifted in having their own unique talents and skills. Therefore, it would be unfair to apply a standardized version of teaching and apply it to every person. This is why everyone who has experienced the, 'American Education System' hates it. Teachers are taught to regurgitate textbooks and out-dated novels to teach the average American, english, or spend an entire year on memorizing the hypotenuse and quadratic formula. Obviously, basic algebra is important, but the amount of time spent on a single topic is ridiculous. This isn't the fault of the student, but the teacher. If the method the teachers uses is terrible, the students knowledge will also be terrible.

So how would you teach someone how to code? Would you enforce coding standards to help them learn? Yes and no. Coding standards is a good baseline to use when teaching someone a new coding language such as Java or C, but enforcing it will make the person hate coding. I have had the opportunity to use two types of coding standards such as ESLINT for IntelliJ and JAVADOC for Java. Although the coding standards helped with my ability to learn either languages syntax, it became a distraction after the initial use. When solving a problem, I need complete focus when typing code that will function properly, but having bright, contrasting, red error marks removes me from my, "zone." I feel inclined to solve the grammar errors before moving to the actual problem. This wastes time and efficiency.

Obviously, this could be interpreted as a personal issue. It may be possible that other software developers agree with the notion that coding standards are necessary for learning a new language, but that doesn't solve the inherent problem. We code because we want to make life easier. In order to solve a problem, we must tell a computer how to solve that problem the easiest way possible. Having coding standards after the initial introduction of the language just hinders the ability of a developer to learn. They have their own way of learning, who are we to tell them their way is wrong?

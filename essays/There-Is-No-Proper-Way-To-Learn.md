Many people think of “coding standards” in a trivial way—i.e. minutae such as how many spaces to indent, or whether you place the close-curly-brace on a new line by itself.

I, on the other hand, think that if you can only implement one software engineering technique to improve quality, it should be coding standards. Indeed, I believe some coding standards can actually help you learn a programming language. Do you agree?

After your first week of using ESLint with IntelliJ, what are your impressions? Are you finding that getting the green checkmark is painful, or useful, or both, or something else entirely?

Write an interesting, informative essay on coding standards that addresses some or all of the above questions, or goes in a different direction entirely regarding coding standards. Make sure it provides your personal perspective and useful insights.

There is no right way to learn. Humans are naturally gifted in having their own unique talents and skills. Therefore, it would be unfair to apply a standardized version of teaching and apply it to every person. This is why everyone who has experienced the, 'American Education System' hates it. Teachers are taught to regurgitate textbooks and out-dated novels to teach the average American, english, or spend an entire year on memorizing the hypotenuse and quadratic formula. Obviously, basic algebra is important, but the amount of time spent on a single topic is ridiculous. This isn't the fault of the student, but the teacher. If the method the teachers uses is terrible, the students knowledge will also be terrible.

## Prologue  
Before disaster struck the United States, I spent my days following a mundane routine: wake up, school, dinner, work, ICSpace, home. It wasn't exciting, but it was honest work. I got done what needed to be done, and I completed goals I wanted to complete. That isn't to say I was happy, however. Following routines without change burnt me out pretty quickly. In the back of my head, I envisioned goals other than educational ones. I wanted to explore the world. I wanted to enjoy the company of friends. I wanted to prepare myself for the future. Unfortunately, those goals would have to stay on hold until the pandemic blows over. 

## What changed? 
The obvious change is my daily routine. Now that quarantine started, I am not able to go outside unless I'm shopping for groceries because my role in society is not, "essential." I've been waking up late because all classes went virtual so it is very easy to fake attendance. I've been spending more time sitting down on my computer due to the lack of commuting to school and work. All in all, my daily routine is very unhealty and I am considering purchasing a desk where you have to stand in order to help my deteriorating health. (March 2020)

I have learned many things about myself due to the pandemic. I am motivated by visible progress which is achieved through smaller goals. Previously, I set my standards too high to the point where it was improbable to stay motivated in completing such tasks. Breaking up goals to smaller ones definitely improved my mental health and I feel connected to myself and my work. Reading my previous entry showed a lack of focus. Instead of seeing the pandemic as an opportunity to do things I've always wanted to do, I instead complained about laziness. Now that majority of my time is spent at home, I am able to work on side-coding projects and other computer science related certification courses I wasn't able to before. (November 2020)

## The Truth 
What additional family, community, or work obligations you are taking on?
My parents own two businesses that are in the brink of bankruptcy due to the lack of clients and customers. You don't know how much we needed the $10k bailout from the federal government that was issued a few days ago or the unemployment insurance that extended its poliy to include my parents situation. 2020 has been very unfortunate but it is what it is. (March 2020)

Fortunately, both of my parents business managed to survive the long summer quarantines. Although the government did a poor job in helping business owners, a lot of citizens that promoted ordering from small businesses (i.e. my parents business) helped a lot. I also had to step up and assist in paying for utitily bills that my family uses because I was forunate enough to keep my job over the quarantine. (November 2020)

## Responsbility 
Due to the (now) heavily enforced quarantine, I had to take on more responsibility. I am a mere computer science college student with little-to-no real life experience and street knowledge. However, I do know about computers. The first, "suggested" quarantine happened before spring break. As a responsible religious institution, we took the quarantine warning very seriously and prepared to switch to online ASAP. The timing couldn't have been more perfect as spring break provided an entire week to troubleshoot Zoom and Youtube Live. My church even promoted my role to Broadcast (lmao). By the end of the week, I set up Youtube Live through OBS, saved the church some money by finding hand-me-down webcams and mics, and provided easy access to Zoom for the senior citizens that go to our church. (March 2020)
 
I am still the head broadcast manager for my church. (November 2020)

## Revelations
Covid 19 has taught me a few things about myself, family, friends, and my community. Covid has taught me that time is the most valuable resource. Time is something we will never get back. Therefore, if we continue to waste everyday doing the same routine that sucks, we might as well be dead because we are not living. Covid has also taught me that my family hates cooking. I didn't notice it before, but now it's clear. We rather eat out than cook 3 meals a day. Covid has also taught me that I chose the right friends (I'll skip this explanation because it is a bit personal). Finally, COVID 19 has taught me that the average person in my community is straight up stupid. Hoarding all the masks and toilet paper so you can price gouge it at a higher price is the dumbest decision you can do and it is straight up illegal. Every apocalyptic movie is wrong about the average American citizen. The majority of people will quarantine and follow professional suggestion, the minority of people will exploit scarce resource, show that they're racist, or believe it's a fake pandemic. What a joke. (March 2020)

My previous entry aged like fine wine. It is currently November 2020 or 8 months since the first day of quarantine and I cannot believe how many people are ignorant to the pandemic. It has been statiscally, and anecdotally proven that masks work. The true purpose of masks are not to protect yourself, but to protect others. It is unfortunate however, the majority of Americans are self-centered and cannot grasp this concept. If everyone wore masks and respected the social distancing laws in the first two months, we would have a full recovery in no time. It is very sad. The only good thing that came out of quarantine was that I had more free time to do things I've always wanted to do such as learn a new instrument, start some side-coding projects, and exercise. (November 2020) 

## So What Now?
All we can do now is continue our lives whilst taking precautions. We shouldn't let the quarantine or virus defeat our capabilities as people. We survived this long because humans can adapt. So we should adapt to the situation by staying home and flattening the curve. (March 2020)

Unfortunately, my previous submission did not age well. The amount of work the smart majority of Americans spent following quarantine regulations and wearing masks were for nothing due to selfish ignorants who believed this was a scamdemic manufactured from China. What we can only do now is to wait for vaccine or force regulations to these ignorants before more people pass away from the virus. (November 2020)
